# deep_vision_AQI

## TODO:
### Root directory
- Final model w/pipeline

### Experiments
- Choose what experiments to leave
- Old attempts at modeling?

### Data
- Don't think we can include Planet images due to copyright (and image size)
- Should be able to keep file to site and AQI stuff for documentation
- Organize the data cleaning files into separate notebooks, or clearly indicate the order
