# Experiments

## Overview
This directory contains relevant experiments done on the dataset in order to achieve the best-performing models in the root directory.

## Structure
- `ColorFreqs.ipynb` : experimentation with color-frequency driven model in attempt to reduce the feature space.
- `manual_CNN_modeling.ipynb` : attempt to create a CNN from scratch on the data before moving to pre-trained networks.
- `pixel_level_modeling.ipynb` : detailed hyperparameter search that yielded the best linear SVM.
- `prediction.ipynb` : experimentation with unlabeled images to produce the final map shown in the report.
